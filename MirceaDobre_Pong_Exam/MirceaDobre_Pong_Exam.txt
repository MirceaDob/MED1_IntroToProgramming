This is my version of the classic game ¨Pong¨.

The user can control the game by using a mouse or trackpad.

Instructions (some are also in the game window) about the commands and rules:
- Left Click to Start/Pause
- Right Click to change the color theme
- move the mouse up and down to control the pad on the right side of the window
- use the pad to hit incoming balls
- do not let the balls cross the line on the right side of the window
- hit the balls 10 times in a row to get a flower
- each hit on a ball gives 1 point
- missing a ball takes -1 from the score
- each hit on a flower gives 10 points
- there can only be 1 flower at a time
- the mouse cursor must be inside the game window for the controls to work

The user can read the score and counter to a streak of 10
in the top right corner of the window.

Thanks for playing,
